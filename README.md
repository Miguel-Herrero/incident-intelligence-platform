# Incident Intelligence Platform

> An AI-powered system for automated incident diagnosis and root cause analysis, built with production-grade infrastructure.

## 🎯 Project Vision

This platform demonstrates how to build reliable, observable, and cost-efficient AI systems for SRE/DevOps workflows. It combines:

- **AI Gateway** (Go): Multi-provider LLM routing, semantic caching, rate limiting, and cost tracking
- **Agent Orchestration** (Python + LangGraph): Multi-agent system for log analysis, metrics correlation, and runbook matching
- **RAG Pipeline**: Multi-source ingestion (logs, metrics, runbooks, code)
- **Evaluation Framework**: Automated evals with quality metrics and CI/CD integration
- **MCP Server**: Standards-based tool exposure for any compatible AI client

## 🚧 Status

**Work in Progress** — This is a 6-month learning-by-building project. Currently on Month X of the roadmap.

See [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) for the complete plan.

## 🏗️ Architecture

TBD

## 🚀 Quick Start

*Coming soon — first milestone: AI Gateway MVP (Month 2)*

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Gateway**: Go, Prometheus, OpenTelemetry
- **Orchestration**: Python 3.11+, LangChain, LangGraph
- **RAG**: Qdrant (vector DB), OpenAI Embeddings
- **Evals**: Custom framework + Langfuse
- **Deploy**: Docker, Docker Compose

## 🎓 Why This Project?

This is my learning path from **Senior Backend Engineer** (Go, Elixir, distributed systems) to **Staff/AI Architect**. I'm documenting the entire journey to help others transitioning from infrastructure engineering to AI platform engineering.
